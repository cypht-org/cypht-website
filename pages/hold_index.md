                        not replace your existing accounts - it combines them into one. And it's also a news reader.</p>

                        accounts, but it's also a standard E-mail client that lets you browse and manage IMAP
                        folders and send outbound messages with SMTP </p>

                    <p> Cypht is an application built entirely of plugins, or as we call them, module sets (which is
                        obviously way cooler sounding than plugins), that are executed by the framework. Modules
                        provide a flexible way to add new features or customize the program without hacking the code

                    <p> Cypht is Open Source (LGPL V2), and written in PHP and JavaScript. If you are looking for a
                        lightweight webmail solution for an ISP, school, business, or just personal use, I hope that
                        Cypht can help!</p>

        <p> We want to hear from you! Drop by the Cypht Gitter channel. We take security seriously. Cypht is an entirely
            volunteer effort, so we can't
            afford a bounty program. We can however promise that any security issue reported to us before release
            will receive a quick response, a thorough review, a sincere thanks, and an honorable mention on this

        <h2>A modular design</h2>
        <p>Instead of an application with a plugin API, Cypht is an application comprised entirely of plugins, or as
            we call them, "module sets". There is only one required set, the "core" modules. The components of any
            module set can be added to, or even replaced, by site specific modules. All the functionality of Cypht
            is broken out into module sets, and each set is built from small pieces that are also easy to override.
