    <h2 id="development-workflow">Development Workflow</h2>
    <p>The project, particularly version 1.4.x, has been designed with plain HTML and CSS, focusing on front-end and back-end development without the use of extra features or frameworks.</p>
    <p>However, it's worth noting that in version 2.1.x, while there's no PHP back-end framework utilized for its back-end, Bootstrap is adopted as the front-end framework, enhancing the project's user interface and experience.</p>
