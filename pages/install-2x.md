        <p>To configure Cypht for your environment, make adjustments to the <a
            href="https://github.com/cypht-org/cypht/blob/2.x/.env.example">.env</a> file according to your
        preferences. The .env file serves as the primary configuration file.</p>

        <p>First edit the .env file to configure Cypht for your environment. If you choose to leverage a database for
            authentication, sessions, or user settings, ensure to complete the relevant sections within the .env file
            based on the information provided in the config/app.php file.</p>

        <p>The necessary SQL commands for creating tables can be found in the config/app.php file, specifically starting
            from line 617 in the "DB Sessions" section. </p>

        title: Other config files
        description: Some Cypht modules necessitate additional configuration files for proper setup. It is crucial that these files are NOT located within the web-server document root. Certain modules may require configuration with a service provider, particularly those related to Oauth2 client setup (such as Github, WordPress, Oauth2 over IMAP for Gmail, and Outlook). After configuring related files, there is no need to rerun the config_gen script; the changes will be automatically merged into the main configuration settings.Alternatively, you can clear your app cache.

            - title: OAUTH2 over IMAP
              description: Gmail and Outlook.com support OAUTH2 authentication over IMAP. This is preferable to normal IMAP authentication because Cypht never has access to your account password.
